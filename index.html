                  <h2>About</h2>
                  <p>Founded by Kenzie Marcum and Kalyn Hall, Bomb Bar is a concept that arose from the collective mindset of the inspiring women around us.  This brand represents the best of all of us.  The inspiration has always been here and now we hope to share it with you! </p>

                  <p>Bomb Bar is a bath, body, and skincare company inspired by fruity daiquiris.  We also serve daiquiris to make your experience more fun! We have a few different flavors that go along with each of our bath products.  We are also devoted to creating  fresh, ethically sourced, cruelty-free, vegetarian, handmade, low-waste, and effective products.  You can order from our site and have it shipped to you, order in-store pick-up, or come in and have a great time!</p>
